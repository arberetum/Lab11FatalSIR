    % fatalSIR.m simulates the proportions of susceptible, infected,
    %   recovered, born, and dead people with the given parameters, initial
    %   conditions, and simulation duration using the fatal susceptible-
    %   infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental model as defined in the

    % Inputs:
    %   s0  = initial proportion of population that is susceptible
    %   i0  = initial proportion of population that is infected
    %   r0  = initial proportion of population that is recovered
    %   alpha = the contagion factor between the susceptible and infected
    %           populations
    %   beta  = the recovery rate
    %   gamma = the rate of returning from the recovered population back to 
    %           the susceptible group
    %   mu_star = the birth rate
    %   mu_s = the death rate for the susceptible population
    %   mu_i = the death rate for the infected population
    %   mu_r = the death rate for the recovered population
